title: THE FLEA AND THE MAN
text: 'A Flea bit a Man, and bit him again, and again, till he could stand it

  no longer, but made a thorough search for it, and at last succeeded

  in catching it. Holding it between his finger and thumb, he said--or

  rather shouted, so angry was he--"Who are you, pray, you wretched

  little creature, that you make so free with my person?" The Flea,

  terrified, whimpered in a weak little voice, "Oh, sir! pray let me

  go; don''t kill me! I am such a little thing that I can''t do you much

  harm." But the Man laughed and said, "I am going to kill you now, at

  once: whatever is bad has got to be destroyed, no matter how slight

  the harm it does."'
moral: Don't let your kindness become a tool for others' self-created problems.
