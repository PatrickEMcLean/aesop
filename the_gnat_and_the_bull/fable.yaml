title: THE GNAT AND THE BULL
text: 'A Gnat alighted on one of the horns of a Bull, and remained sitting

  there for a considerable time. When it had rested sufficiently and was

  about to fly away, it said to the Bull, "Do you mind if I go now?" The

  Bull merely raised his eyes and remarked, without interest, "It''s all

  one to me; I didn''t notice when you came, and I shan''t know when you

  go away."'
moral: Perception of oneself is not always aligned with reality or how we are seen
  by others.
