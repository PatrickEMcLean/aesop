title: THE NIGHTINGALE AND THE SWALLOW
text: 'A Swallow, conversing with a Nightingale, advised her to quit the

  leafy coverts where she made her home, and to come and live with men,

  like herself, and nest under the shelter of their roofs. But the

  Nightingale replied, "Time was when I too, like yourself, lived among

  men: but the memory of the cruel wrongs I then suffered makes them

  hateful to me, and never again will I approach their dwellings."'
moral: Your past should not dictate your ability to find joy in the present.
