title: DEMADES AND HIS FABLE
text: "Demades the orator was once speaking in the Assembly at Athens; but\nthe people\
  \ were very inattentive to what he was saying, so he stopped\nand said, \"Gentlemen,\
  \ I should like to tell you one of \xC6sop's fables.\"\nThis made every one listen\
  \ intently. Then Demades began: \"Demeter, a\nSwallow, and an Eel were once travelling\
  \ together, and came to a river\nwithout a bridge: the Swallow flew over it, and\
  \ the Eel swam across\";\nand then he stopped. \"What happened to Demeter?\" cried\
  \ several people\nin the audience. \"Demeter,\" he replied, \"is very angry with\
  \ you for\nlistening to fables when you ought to be minding public business.\""
