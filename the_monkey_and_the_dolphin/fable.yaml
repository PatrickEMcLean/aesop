title: THE MONKEY AND THE DOLPHIN
text: "When people go on a voyage they often take with them lap-dogs or\nmonkeys as\
  \ pets to wile away the time. Thus it fell out that a man\nreturning to Athens from\
  \ the East had a pet Monkey on board with him.\nAs they neared the coast of Attica\
  \ a great storm burst upon them, and\nthe ship capsized. All on board were thrown\
  \ into the water, and tried\nto save themselves by swimming, the Monkey among the\
  \ rest. A Dolphin\nsaw him, and, supposing him to be a man, took him on his back\
  \ and\nbegan swimming towards the shore. When they got near the Pir\xE6us, which\n\
  is the port of Athens, the Dolphin asked the Monkey if he was an\nAthenian. The\
  \ Monkey replied that he was, and added that he came of\na very distinguished family.\
  \ \"Then, of course, you know the Pir\xE6us,\"\ncontinued the Dolphin. The Monkey\
  \ thought he was referring to some\nhigh official or other, and replied, \"Oh, yes,\
  \ he's a very old friend\nof mine.\" At that, detecting his hypocrisy, the Dolphin\
  \ was so\ndisgusted that he dived below the surface, and the unfortunate Monkey\n\
  was quickly drowned."
