title: THE SPENDTHRIFT AND THE SWALLOW
text: 'A Spendthrift, who had wasted his fortune, and had nothing left but

  the clothes in which he stood, saw a Swallow one fine day in early

  spring. Thinking that summer had come, and that he could now do

  without his coat, he went and sold it for what it would fetch. A

  change, however, took place in the weather, and there came a sharp

  frost which killed the unfortunate Swallow. When the Spendthrift saw

  its dead body he cried, "Miserable bird! Thanks to you I am perishing

  of cold myself."'
moral: Consistent effort and resilience leads to continued success.
