title: THE STAG AND THE LION
text: 'A Stag was chased by the hounds, and took refuge in a cave, where he

  hoped to be safe from his pursuers. Unfortunately the cave contained a

  Lion, to whom he fell an easy prey. "Unhappy that I am," he cried, "I

  am saved from the power of the dogs only to fall into the clutches of

  a Lion."'
moral: Consider all outcomes before hastily escaping a difficult situation.
