title: THE BOY BATHING
text: 'A Boy was bathing in a river and got out of his depth, and was in

  great danger of being drowned. A man who was passing along a road

  heard his cries for help, and went to the riverside and began to scold

  him for being so careless as to get into deep water, but made no

  attempt to help him. "Oh, sir," cried the Boy, "please help me first

  and scold me afterwards."'
moral: When adversity strikes, one's true character is revealed by their deeds, not
  their speech.
