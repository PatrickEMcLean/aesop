title: THE CRAB AND THE FOX
text: 'A Crab once left the sea-shore and went and settled in a meadow some

  way inland, which looked very nice and green and seemed likely to be a

  good place to feed in. But a hungry Fox came along and spied the Crab

  and caught him. Just as he was going to be eaten up, the Crab said,

  "This is just what I deserve; for I had no business to leave my

  natural home by the sea and settle here as though I belonged to the

  land."'
moral: Always be satisfied with what you have rather than desiring what you don't
  possess.
