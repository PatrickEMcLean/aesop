title: THE VIPER AND THE FILE
text: 'A Viper entered a carpenter''s shop, and went from one to another of

  the tools, begging for something to eat. Among the rest, he addressed

  himself to the File, and asked for the favour of a meal. The File

  replied in a tone of pitying contempt, "What a simpleton you must be

  if you imagine you will get anything from me, who invariably take from

  every one and never give anything in return."'
moral: Greed often overlooks the value of generosity and sharing.
